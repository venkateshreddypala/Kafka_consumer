# Kafka_consumer
using Kafka to process inventory data. They have a topic called inventory_purchases which is receiving data about the items being purchased and the quantity. However, there is still a legacy system which must ingest this data in the form of a data file.

You have been asked to create a consumer that will read the data from the topic and output to a data file.
